## Paper Details

**Title:** Algebraic Composition of Online Data Reductions: A Type-Safe Framework for Numerical Stability

**Abstract:** The paper presents accumux, a modern C++ header-only library that introduces algebraic composition operators for online data reduction algorithms. It addresses numerical stability in single-pass algorithms while providing intuitive, type-safe composition of multiple reduction operations.
