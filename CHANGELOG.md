  - `accumulator_concept.hpp`: Unified concepts for type-safe accumulator composition
  - `Accumulator` concept with standardized interface for all accumulators
  - `StatisticalAccumulator` and `VarianceAccumulator` specialized concepts
  - Compile-time compatibility checking between accumulator types

- **Numerically Stable Accumulators**
  - `kbn_sum<T>`: Kahan-Babu≈°ka-Neumaier summation with O(1) error bounds
  - `welford_accumulator<T>`: Welford's algorithm for online mean and variance
  - `min_accumulator<T>`, `max_accumulator<T>`: Extrema tracking
  - `minmax_accumulator<T>`: Combined min/max with optimized dual tracking
  - `count_accumulator`: Element counting
  - `product_accumulator<T>`: Product computation with overflow protection

- **Composition System**
  - `parallel_composition<A, B>`: Simultaneous processing (a + b syntax)
  - `sequential_composition<A, B>`: Pipeline processing (a * b syntax)
  - `conditional_composition<A, B, P>`: Predicate-based accumulator selection
  - Natural algebraic syntax with operator overloading
  - Type-safe composition with C++20 concepts

- **Mathematical Guarantees**
  - Associative composition operations
  - Structure-preserving homomorphisms between accumulator types
  - Single-pass algorithms with O(1) space complexity
  - Numerical stability with bounded error growth

- **Performance Features**

  - Cache-friendly memory layout and access patterns
  - SIMD-ready architecture for vectorization
  - Parallel composition enables multiple statistics in single pass

- **Testing and Quality**
  - Comprehensive test suite with 63+ tests
  - 100% line coverage on core accumulator implementations
  - Unit tests for individual accumulator functionality
  - Integration tests for composition behavior
  - Numerical accuracy verification against reference implementations
  - Performance benchmarks with large datasets
  - Property-based testing for mathematical guarantees
  - Edge case testing (empty data, single values, extreme values)

- **Documentation and Examples**
  - Complete API documentation with usage examples
  - Real-world use cases (financial analysis, quality control)
  - Performance benchmarks and guidelines
  - Mathematical foundation explanations
  - Installation and integration instructions

### Technical Details
- **Language**: C++20 with concepts, constexpr, and modern template features
- **Compiler Support**: GCC 10+, Clang 10+, MSVC 19.29+
- **Architecture**: Header-only library, no external dependencies
- **Platforms**: Linux, macOS, Windows, any C++20 compliant environment
- **Build System**: CMake 3.14+ for tests and examples

### Performance
- Single KBN Sum: ~2.1ms for 1M values (476M values/sec)
- Parallel Sum + Welford: ~4.8ms for 1M values (208M values/sec)
- Complex 4-way composition: ~8.2ms for 1M values (122M values/sec)

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Package manager support (Conan, vcpkg)
- Extended accumulator library (quantiles, histograms)
- GPU acceleration support
- Distributed accumulation patterns
- Advanced composition patterns (nested, recursive)
